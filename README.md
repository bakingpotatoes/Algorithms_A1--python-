NEW SOLUTION THAT DOESNT REQUIRE A VENV:::
<ol>
 <li>Install the files as zip</li>
 <li>Extract as a folder of any type</li>
 <li>Open your VSC and select that folder</li>
 <li>Make sure your python intepretor is your GLOBAL (3.13.3)</li>
 <li>Open your cmd in VSC</li>
 <li>type "pip install -r requirements.txt" (dont worry its just pygame)</li>

 <li>You're free to run it</li>
</ol>
